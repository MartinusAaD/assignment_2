## Project Information

This website is used to get information about the different players on FÃ¸rde Volleyball Clubs Elite team. The project was used to learn more about grid and flex systems.

Alternative design would be to group the different players based on their position, and code a side scroll for the different positions. Making the page much shorter for the smaller screens.

## Navigation

The website has a basic navbar to navigate between the players info and a leaderboard.
